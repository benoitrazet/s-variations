- (2018-06-02) In the savitch engine that count the number of
  solutions, remove the use of the bound (2^{n1+n2}) because the
  fixpoint will be reached before reaching the bound. Remove `bound`
  in variation2 and revise variation3.

- (2018-05-31) Add correctness test for different versions

- (2018-05-26) Have comprehensive testing for all the variations

- (2018-05-26) Use a logger

- (2018-05-26) Generalize the search algorithm into an engine parametrized by an emuration

- ~~(2018-05-26) add testing to modules (transitive closure). Tests would show examples and allow to catch regression~~ (2018-05-29)
